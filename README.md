# Bacon's Law Project

From Harvard's free course: CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

Bacon's Law, also known as the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, is a parlor game and concept that 
suggests any two people in the world can be connected through a chain of six or fewer acquaintances.

The program takes two actors from the data set and finds the shortest path between them by choosing a 
sequence of movies that connects them, using Breadth-first search (BFS).

## Files/Folders

- util.py
- degrees.py
- Folder called small containing data (actors, movies etc)

Task: Complete the implementation of the "shortest_path" function such that it returns the shortest path 
from the person with id source to the person with the id target. You should not modify anything else. You can
add function and use the code from the lecture examples.
